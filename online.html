                This was during my time studying 2D Animation. 
                This is where we had  to work on children's animated series, dedicated to
                and focused on having a much more expressive and fun way to teach
                children who speak sign language (deaf children) new things, like words and take them on an educational adventure.
                We created characters and the world they live in and we had to write some scripts 
                to give ourselves the feel as to what the character was like and how they moved.
